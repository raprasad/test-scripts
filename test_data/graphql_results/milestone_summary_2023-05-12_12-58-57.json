Another approach for numeric data, that would avoid specifying a candidate set up front would be to take in a sorted vector of (value, score) pairs. The exponential mechanism chooses a pair, and then a value is chosen uniformly from the region halfway to the prior value and halfway to the next value. This has different memory overheads though- the sorted input tuples will be expensive to compute and have double the memory overhead. It may be possible to formulate this as a combinator that evaluates each utility sequentially, and selecting an element via the gumbel distribution.\nChristina's base-2 exponential would be a more robust solution for noising, but I think that belongs in its own issue.",

We also have a copy of \"Algorithm AS241: The Percentage Points of the Normal Distribution\", which is used in computing the tau threshold for dimension censoring with gaussian.\n\nIdeally, OpenDP could take a desired epsilon and delta and tell us the threshold to use for censoring rare dimensions.  This one is somewhat a concern because it's too easy for the thresholding computation to get out of sync with the actual mechanism that computes the counts, when updates to the counting mechanism are made.\n\nPriority: Longer-term after interactive measurements",
